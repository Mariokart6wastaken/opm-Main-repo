# opm-Main-repo
Put any opm apps here!

Please put your app in a folder like this: /[appname]/com.[developer].[appname].app (your .app must be a DIRECTORY and contain a main.lua and appinfo.dat or it will FAIL TO RUN)
CLI/CraftOS Native apps should be labeled as such and are packed differently (/[appname].lua)
Please keep your apps complient with the windowing system (account for different scaling and and changing sizes while the application is running)
Please remember that your app cannot be launched with flags using the desktop ui, so make sure to account for that.
BingOS apps will NOT work natively under the obsidian api, you will have to port them.
Remember to test your apps and read the api documentation. (coming soon)
